Capstone Group 5 Project
========================

I was a little bored in the past couple of days, thus the whole code based were refactored.

There are main changes and various branch that became the output:
    vEx -- contains experimental and untested changes, but should come with significant optimizations.
        *main branch (this branch) also contains the said changes
    v1.f -- derived from v1.0, and main branch before the start of the commit.
        *this branch is unoptimized and is bloated with stupid code and mechanisms.

====
vEx changelog:

- strict compliance to
    1. pep 0008
    2. pep 0257
    3. pep 484
    4. pep 0526
- optimizations of algorithm
- increased security, as opposed to v1.0 and v1.f which stores the 32-key generated password in its raw form in text file, vEx stores its sha256 hash, and use of getpass instead of raw input function
- removal of unnecessary parts
- fix of experimental parts of v1.0 and v1.f, since the said branch also contains experimental and untested code, but is significantly less than vEx branch.
- fix of setup scripts
- updated dir and adaption of the change of name in the manscript (taptap -> easywiz)
- project structure update
- easier log in due to use of sequence matcher ratios
