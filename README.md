# Student database

This branch of repository is the database of TapTap, this is not private, but can only be edited by administrators. This can be pulled or cloned with:

```bash
git clone --branch database https://github.com/testno0/capstone
```

And since by default, `git` names the folder by the name of the repository, for the program to recognize it, rename it to `repo`:

```bash
mv capstone repo
```

Or do it via GUI.
